SQL PROJECT This project demonstrates how to manage and manipulate data using SQL and SQLite within a Python environment. It covers essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations as well as more advanced queries such as joins and aggregate functions.

- Project Structure Tables: alunos (Students): Contains student data including id, name, age, and course. clientes (Clients): Stores client information such as id, name, age, and balance. compras (Purchases): Records purchase details with fields for id, client_id (foreign key referencing clientes), product, and value.
- Key Functionalities: Table Creation & Data Insertion: Creating tables and inserting records using SQL commands.
- Basic Queries: Retrieving records using SELECT statements with conditions.
- Aggregate Functions: Calculating metrics such as average balance, maximum balance, and counts using functions like AVG(), MAX(), and COUNT().
- Data Manipulation: Updating and deleting records based on specific conditions.
- Joins: Combining data from multiple tables to display comprehensive information (e.g., linking clients to their purchases).

The code is implemented using Pythonâ€™s sqlite3 module and is designed for educational purposes, illustrating practical examples of SQL operations. This project is ideal for those learning SQL and database management as it provides hands-on experience with real data manipulation tasks.
